### üß© Patch: Interactive Prompt Builder Implementation
üîó task_id: prompt-builder-interactive-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: prompt-builder.html, js/prompt-builder.js

## Action Summary
Enhanced the prompt builder interface to allow users to construct effective prompts by selecting and combining techniques from the taxonomy. The implementation includes:

1. Added template selection dropdown with various prompt templates
2. Improved technique selection UI with filtering by skill level
3. Added real-time suggestions based on selected techniques
4. Implemented keyboard shortcuts for better usability
5. Added ability to save/load prompts for future reference
6. Enhanced preview with syntax highlighting for better readability
7. Added token counting for prompt length estimation

## Implementation Details
- Updated the HTML structure to support template blocks
- Enhanced the JavaScript logic to handle template selection and population
- Added skill level filtering for beginner/intermediate/advanced users
- Implemented local storage for saved prompts
- Added keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to copy, Ctrl+S to save)
- Refined the UI for a more intuitive workflow

## Technical Approach
The implementation follows a modular design pattern, with clear separation between:
- Data management (techniques, templates, saved prompts)
- UI components (selectors, editors, preview) 
- User interaction handling (events, keyboard shortcuts)

All techniques data is embedded directly in the JavaScript to avoid CORS issues with local files.
