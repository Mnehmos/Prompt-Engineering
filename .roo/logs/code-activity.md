### üß© Patch: Interactive Prompt Builder Implementation
üîó task_id: prompt-builder-interactive-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: prompt-builder.html, js/prompt-builder.js

## Action Summary
Enhanced the prompt builder interface to allow users to construct effective prompts by selecting and combining techniques from the taxonomy. The implementation includes:

1. Added template selection dropdown with various prompt templates
2. Improved technique selection UI with filtering by skill level
3. Added real-time suggestions based on selected techniques
4. Implemented keyboard shortcuts for better usability
5. Added ability to save/load prompts for future reference
6. Enhanced preview with syntax highlighting for better readability
7. Added token counting for prompt length estimation

## Implementation Details
- Updated the HTML structure to support template blocks
- Enhanced the JavaScript logic to handle template selection and population
- Added skill level filtering for beginner/intermediate/advanced users
- Implemented local storage for saved prompts
- Added keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to copy, Ctrl+S to save)
- Refined the UI for a more intuitive workflow

## Technical Approach
The implementation follows a modular design pattern, with clear separation between:
- Data management (techniques, templates, saved prompts)
- UI components (selectors, editors, preview) 
- User interaction handling (events, keyboard shortcuts)

All techniques data is embedded directly in the JavaScript to avoid CORS issues with local files.
### üß© Task: Create Comprehensive Landing Page
üîó task_id: pe-taxonomy-landing-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: index.html

#### Changes Made
Created an enhanced landing page that provides a cohesive entry point to all components of the Prompt Engineering Taxonomy project. Key improvements include:

- Added comprehensive SEO metadata with proper description, keywords, and Open Graph tags
- Created a more compelling hero section with an improved headline and value proposition
- Added a prominent "Quick Start" call-to-action box for immediate access to key features
- Implemented "Key Features" section with visual cards explaining the main project components
- Added "Featured Techniques" section to highlight important prompt engineering approaches
- Expanded the "About" section with more detailed project information
- Enhanced the visual presentation with additional custom styles
- Improved responsive design for better mobile compatibility
- Added visual dividers and improved overall page flow
- Maintained consistent navigation and linking to all key components

The page now properly explains the purpose and value of the project, provides overview of the techniques, and links to all major components (taxonomy visualization, relationship visualization, prompt builder).

#### Technical Notes
- Maintained consistent styling with the site's existing CSS framework
- Used inline styles for landing page-specific components
- Ensured all links to other pages are working properly
- Added appropriate icons from Font Awesome for visual enhancement
- Implemented responsive grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
### üß© Patch: Complete Node Mapping for All Categories in Relationship Visualization
üîó task_id: pe-taxonomy-relationship-nodes-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: assets/js/network-visualization.js

#### Changes Made
- Added embedded data for the following categories: Agent & Tool Use, Self-Improvement, Retrieval & Augmentation, Prompt Optimization, Multimodal Techniques, and Specialized Application.
- Populated each with representative techniques and realistic inter-category relationships.
- Ensured node mapping and filtering now work for all major categories in the network visualization.

#### Result
The relationship visualization page (`reports/technique-relationships.html`) now supports node mapping and filtering for all taxonomy categories, as requested.
### üß© Patch: Enhance Sources Page with Visual Improvements
üîó task_id: sources-page-enhancement-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: sources.html, assets/css/styles.css

#### Changes Made
- Added a hero section with gradient background to match other pages
- Improved paper cards with better styling and hover effects
- Added icons to enhance visual hierarchy and improve scannability
- Organized research papers in a grid layout with category icons
- Added custom CSS specifically for the sources page
- Improved spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness

#### Result
The sources page now has a more polished, visually appealing design that matches the style of other pages in the site. The content is better organized with clear visual hierarchy, making it easier to scan and navigate.
### üß© Patch: Fix Prompt Builder Copy Functionality
üîó task_id: prompt-builder-copy-fix-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: js/prompt-builder.js

#### Changes Made
- Added a `rawPromptText` property to the `PromptBuilder` class to store the plain text version of the prompt without HTML formatting
- Modified the `updatePromptPreview()` function to store the raw text version of the prompt before applying syntax highlighting
- Updated the `copyPromptToClipboard()` function to use the raw text version instead of getting the text content from the DOM

#### Result
The "Copy to Clipboard" button now correctly copies the plain text version of the prompt without any HTML formatting tags. This ensures that users get clean, properly formatted text when pasting the prompt into other applications.

#### Technical Notes
- This approach maintains the visual formatting in the preview while ensuring clean text for clipboard operations
- The solution is minimal and maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- No changes to the HTML structure were required
### üß© Patch: Redesign Prompt Builder Interface for Improved Usability
üîó task_id: prompt-builder-redesign-001
üóÇÔ∏è Files: prompt-builder.html, js/prompt-builder.js

#### Action Summary
Redesigned the prompt builder interface to provide a more intuitive, step-by-step user experience with the following improvements:

1. **Implemented a Wizard-Style Interface**:
   - Created a 4-step process: "Select Techniques", "Choose Template", "Fill Details", and "Review & Copy"
   - Added visual progress indicators and numbered steps
   - Implemented navigation between steps with back/next buttons

2. **Enhanced Visual Design**:
   - Improved spacing and visual hierarchy
   - Added visual feedback for selected techniques
   - Enhanced the preview section with better formatting
   - Added icons for better visual cues

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Added technique count badge
   - Made selected techniques more visually distinct
   - Implemented conditional button enabling/disabling based on user progress
   - Added clear visual separation between sections

#### File Paths Affected
- `prompt-builder.html`: Updated HTML structure to implement the wizard interface
- `js/prompt-builder.js`: Added JavaScript functionality to handle wizard navigation

#### Schema or Pattern Impact
No schema changes were made. The redesign maintains all existing functionality while improving the user interface.

#### Related Task or Feature
This redesign addresses user feedback that the prompt builder interface was cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to use effectively.
