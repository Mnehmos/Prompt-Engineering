# Prompt Engineering Techniques Taxonomy

An interactive web-based catalog of 100+ prompt engineering techniques organized into categories, based on research from 17 academic papers.

## Overview

This project transforms the comprehensive list of prompt engineering techniques compiled by Reddit user [Background-Zombie869](https://www.reddit.com/user/Background-Zombie869) into an organized, searchable, and visually appealing resource.

The original content was shared in a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1k4iykr/i_distilled_17_research_papers_into_a_taxonomy_of/) where the author distilled 17 research papers to create a taxonomy of 100+ prompt engineering techniques.

## Features

- **Categorized Techniques**: Browse techniques organized by categories such as basic concepts, reasoning frameworks, agent techniques, and more
- **Dual View Modes**: Switch between card view and list view based on your preference
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific techniques by name, description, or source
- **Detailed Information**: Each technique includes:
  - Full description
  - Source paper(s)
  - Related techniques
  - Category classification
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Categories

The taxonomy organizes techniques into the following categories:

1. **Basic Concepts**: Fundamental prompting structures and conceptual frameworks
2. **Reasoning Frameworks**: Techniques that guide the model through explicit reasoning steps
3. **Agent & Tool Use**: Techniques that enable LLMs to interact with external tools and environments
4. **Self-Improvement Techniques**: Methods for the model to reflect on and improve its own outputs
5. **Retrieval & Augmentation**: Techniques that incorporate external knowledge into prompts
6. **Prompt Optimization**: Techniques to automate and improve prompt engineering
7. **Multimodal Techniques**: Techniques involving non-text modalities like images, audio, and video
8. **Specialized Application Techniques**: Techniques optimized for specific domains or applications

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use the search bar to find specific techniques
3. Filter techniques by category using the category buttons
4. Toggle between card and list view with the view switcher
5. Click on any technique to view detailed information
