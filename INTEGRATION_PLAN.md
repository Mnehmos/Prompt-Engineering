# AI Team Frameworks Integration Plan
## Expanding Prompt Engineering Taxonomy with Advanced Agentic Engineering

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of three advanced research repositories into the Prompt Engineering Taxonomy website:
- **Building a Structured AI Team** (Operational Framework)
- **Integrating AI Teams with LCM** (Semantic Foundation) 
- **Detecting and Correcting Emergent Errors** (Reliability & Safety)

Together, these represent a comprehensive methodology for advanced agentic engineering that extends beyond simple prompt techniques into sophisticated multi-agent system design.

## Analysis of Source Materials

### Repository 1: Building a Structured AI Team

- Token optimization ("Scalpel, not Hammer" philosophy)
- Structured documentation and traceability

**Educational Value**: Provides concrete, actionable patterns for organizing AI workflows

### Repository 2: Integrating AI Teams with LCM  
**Core Contribution**: Semantic Foundation through Language Construct Modeling

**Key Concepts**:
- Language Construct Modeling (LCM) for semantic precision
- Form-meaning pairings (constructions) from Construction Grammar
- Semantic primitives as building blocks
- Computationally grounded semantics
- Meta Prompt Layering (MPL) for structured prompt orchestration
- Semantic Channel Equalization for inter-agent communication

**Educational Value**: Bridges the gap between simple prompting and sophisticated semantic control

### Repository 3: Detecting and Correcting Emergent Errors
**Core Contribution**: Reliability & Safety Layer for Complex AI Systems

**Key Concepts**:
- Semantic drift detection and mode-specific guardrails
- Cross-task consistency validation
- Model-Specific Adaptation Layer (MSAL)
- Task boundary enforcement and sandbox modes
- Conditional auto-approval systems

  name: "Technique Name",
  description: "Clear explanation of the technique",
  category: "Multi-Agent Systems & Team Frameworks",
  subcategory: "Team Architecture Patterns",
  useCase: "When to apply this technique",
  example: "Concrete implementation example",
  sources: ["Mnehmos et al.", "Building Structured AI Teams"],
  relatedTechniques: ["semantic-guardrails", "boomerang-delegation"],
  tips: "Implementation best practices",
  commonMistakes: "What to avoid",
  complexity: "advanced",
  // New fields for advanced techniques
  prerequisites: ["basic-prompting", "multi-agent-concepts"],
  implementations: {
    "roo-code": "Specific implementation in Roo Code",
    "custom": "Generic implementation approach"
  },
  riskLevel: "medium", // low/medium/high
  maturityLevel: "experimental" // experimental/emerging/established
}
```

### Phase 4: Educational Progression Design

Create learning paths that build from basic prompting to advanced agentic engineering:

**Beginner Path**: Basic Prompting → Role-Based Prompting → Simple Agent Patterns

3. **Semantic Pattern Library**: Searchable repository of LCM constructs
4. **Error Pattern Database**: Community-contributed error examples
5. **Implementation Templates**: Ready-to-use code examples

## Implementation Approach

### Data Structure Updates

Update the existing embedded data pattern to include new fields:

```javascript
// In assets/js/data-loader.js, js/prompt-builder.js, etc.
const advancedTechniquesData = {
  categories: [
    {
      id: "multi-agent-systems",
      name: "Multi-Agent Systems & Team Frameworks",
      subcategories: [
        {
          id: "team-architecture",
          name: "Team Architecture Patterns",
          techniques: [
            // New technique objects with advanced fields
          ]
        }
        // ... other subcategories
