## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Basic understanding of JSON and JavaScript
- Familiarity with prompt engineering concepts

### Initial Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies (if any): `npm install`
4. Run validation to understand current status: `node scripts/data-validation.js`

## üìä Data Quality Standards

### Required Fields for All Techniques

Every technique MUST include:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier in kebab-case (e.g., `chain-of-thought`)
- **`name`**: Human-readable name (e.g., "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting")
- **`description`**: Clear, concise explanation (minimum 20 characters)
- **`sources`**: Array of academic papers, articles, or authoritative references

### Recommended Fields

For complete techniques, include:

- **`useCase`**: When and why to use this technique
- **`example`**: Practical example demonstrating the technique
- **`relatedTechniques`**: Array of related technique IDs

### Quality Enhancement Fields

For high-priority techniques, add:

- **`tips`**: Best practices and implementation guidance
- **`commonMistakes`**: What to avoid when using this technique
- **`aliases`**: Alternative names or abbreviations

### Data Quality Requirements

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming, formatting, and structure
2. **Accuracy**: Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date
3. **Completeness**: Provide comprehensive metadata for core techniques
4. **Clarity**: Write descriptions that are accessible to both beginners and experts
5. **Sources**: Always cite authoritative sources for technique information

## ‚ûï Adding New Techniques

### Step 1: Research and Documentation

1. **Verify Uniqueness**: Check that the technique doesn't already exist
2. **Gather Sources**: Collect at least 2-3 authoritative references
3. **Understand Context**: Determine the appropriate category
4. **Draft Content**: Prepare all required and recommended fields

### Step 2: Choose the Correct Category

Current categories:
- **Basic Concepts**: Fundamental prompting structures
- **Reasoning Frameworks**: Techniques for explicit reasoning
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Advanced coordination techniques

### Step 3: Add to Master Data File

Add your technique to `data/processed/techniques.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "your-technique-id",
  "name": "Your Technique Name",
  "description": "Clear description of what this technique does and how it works.",
  "sources": ["Author et al. (Year)", "Another Source"],
  "relatedTechniques": ["related-technique-1", "related-technique-2"],
  "useCase": "When and why to use this technique.",
  "example": "Practical example showing the technique in action.",
  "tips": "Best practices for implementation.",
  "commonMistakes": "What to avoid when using this technique."
}
```

### Step 4: Validate and Synchronize

1. Run validation: `node scripts/data-validation.js`
2. Run synchronization: `node scripts/data-synchronizer.js`
3. Verify no errors or warnings for your new technique

## ‚ú® Enhancing Existing Techniques

### Priority Enhancement Order

Focus on these techniques first (HIGH priority):
1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
2. Zero-Shot Learning/Prompting  
3. Few-Shot Learning/Prompting
4. Basic Prompting
5. In-Context Learning (ICL)
6. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)
7. Self-Consistency
8. ReAct (Reason + Act)
9. Self-Correction techniques
10. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Enhancement Process

1. **Identify Missing Fields**: Use validation output to see what's missing
2. **Research Best Practices**: Find authoritative guidance for the technique
3. **Draft Content**: Write clear, actionable content for missing fields
4. **Add to Master File**: Update `data/processed/techniques.json`
5. **Validate**: Run validation to ensure quality

### Example Enhancement

Before:
```json
{
  "id": "chain-of-thought",
  "name": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting",
  "description": "Eliciting step-by-step reasoning before the final answer.",
  "sources": ["Wei et al."]
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "id": "chain-of-thought",
  "name": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting", 
  "description": "Eliciting step-by-step reasoning before the final answer.",
  "sources": ["Wei et al."],
  "useCase": "Complex reasoning tasks, math problems, logical deductions, and multi-step decision processes.",
  "tips": "Provide clear, detailed reasoning steps in examples. Break down complex problems into smaller, logical steps.",
  "commonMistakes": "Skipping intermediate steps. Using overly complex examples that confuse the model.",
  "example": "Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls...\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step:\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls\n..."
}
```

## üîç Data Validation and Quality Assurance

### Available Tools

1. **Validation Tool**: `node scripts/data-validation.js`
   - Checks for missing required fields
   - Identifies inconsistencies across files
   - Reports metadata completeness statistics

2. **Metadata Enhancer**: `node scripts/metadata-enhancer.js`
   - Automatically adds missing metadata for priority techniques
   - Creates backups before modifications

3. **Data Synchronizer**: `node scripts/data-synchronizer.js`
   - Synchronizes data across all embedded files
   - Fixes structural inconsistencies

### Quality Assurance Workflow

1. **Before Making Changes**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/data-validation.js
   ```

2. **After Adding/Modifying Techniques**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/data-validation.js
   node scripts/data-synchronizer.js
   node scripts/data-validation.js  # Verify improvements
   ```

3. **Batch Enhancement** (for multiple techniques):
   ```bash
   node scripts/metadata-enhancer.js
   node scripts/data-synchronizer.js
   node scripts/data-validation.js
   ```

## üìÅ File Structure and Synchronization

### Primary Data Files

- **`data/processed/techniques.json`**: Master data file (source of truth)
- **`data/processed/technique_categories.json`**: Category definitions
- **`js/prompt-builder.js`**: Embedded data for prompt builder
- **`assets/js/data-loader.js`**: Embedded data for main interface

### Synchronization Process

The master file (`data/processed/techniques.json`) is the source of truth. All other files are synchronized from it:

1. Make changes only to the master file
2. Run the synchronizer to update all embedded files
3. Validate that all files are consistent

### Backup Strategy

All modification tools automatically create timestamped backups:
- Format: `filename.backup.YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss-sssZ`
- Stored in the same directory as the original file
- Safe to delete old backups after verification

## üéØ Best Practices

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Descriptions**: Be concise but comprehensive. Aim for 50-200 words.
2. **Use Cases**: Focus on practical applications and when to choose this technique over others.
3. **Examples**: Use realistic, relatable scenarios that clearly demonstrate the technique.
4. **Tips**: Provide actionable guidance that helps users succeed.
5. **Common Mistakes**: Include real pitfalls that users encounter.

### Technical Guidelines

1. **IDs**: Use kebab-case, be descriptive but concise
2. **Names**: Include common abbreviations in parentheses
3. **Sources**: Use consistent citation format: "Author et al. (Year)"
4. **Related Techniques**: Link to genuinely related concepts

### Quality Metrics

Aim for these completion rates:
- **Required fields**: 100%
- **Use cases**: 80%+
- **Examples**: 80%+
- **Tips**: 60%+ (focus on high-priority techniques)
- **Common mistakes**: 60%+ (focus on high-priority techniques)
